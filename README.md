Youtube publishes audio content typically with descriptions in one of two formats: Either the 'Provided to YouTube ... Auto-generated by YouTube.' (see [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op9ApJJyhD4])) or the table format (see [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgIc3fj9iuU])). This scripts works on both formats and extracts the information like title, artist, and album.
